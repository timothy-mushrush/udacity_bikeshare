## Description:
This project was conducted as part of the Udacity *"Programming for Data Science with Python"* course. It takes in 
user inputs to first select a particular city's data. Second, the user is prompted to choose month and/or day of the 
week to analyze. Lastly, some significant statistics about the data that the user selected for will be displayed. 
This whole thing should provide the user with an interactive and hopefully helpful view into the 
bikeshare data presented.
