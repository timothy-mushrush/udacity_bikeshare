### Description
This project was conducted as part of the Udacity Python data science/programming course. It takes in user inputs to
first select a particular city's data. Second, the user is prompted to choose month and/or day of the week to analyze.
Lastly, some significant statistics about the data that the user selected for will be displayed. This whole thing should
provide the user with an interactive and hopefully helpful view into the bikeshare data presented.
